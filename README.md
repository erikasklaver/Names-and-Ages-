# Names-and-Ages-
//This program will create a list of twenty random first and last names with //a height and age associated with each name. The user will be asked for a //last name and the program will search for that last name within the list. //if the name is in the list, the program will print out all the information //about that person. This program will also ask the user to select an age range //and enter two numbers. The program will then show the user all the people //in the list that are within their selected age range.
